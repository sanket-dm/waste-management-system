# waste-management-system

Waste disposal is a major cause for concern in the present world. Unplanned open dumping without categorization at landfill sites made by municipal is a common method of waste disposal  creates environmental and health hazards. 

With the help of our project, we aim to help mitigate waste disposal expenditure, namely labour costs associated with segregation. With this project, we aim to segregate waste into 3 categories (i.e. Metal, Wet and Dry). 

We also added a feature which indicates the level of waste present in the bin, thus helping management to create appropriate plans regarding waste disposal timing and schedules.
